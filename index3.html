        <p style="font-size: large;" class="paragraph"> My Dog on the bed, he likes it more on the bed however we dont like it when he is on the bed as he sheds a lot of fur and my bed would smell like dog. He is very cautious of the bed as we almost never let him on the bed, Pablo is kind of scared of the bed but pablos likes it on the bed. He has a white symbol under his mouth that resembles a bishop's piece in chess.</p>

            Here is my dog Pablo on my fathers Lap, as you can see he is very excited being on my fathers lap, He has never been lift up that high before. Pablo is drooling with excitement and is very happy. You dont see it but there is another dog outside the picture that Pablo sees that is partially why he is excited. Unfortunately the Dog has sadly passed away this 2023, may she rest in peace.
