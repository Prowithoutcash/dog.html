            His name is Pablo, He is 13 Kilograms. He scratches the glass door to signify that he wants to go inside, he almost never barks however this sunday he has become more fond of barking into the glass door so he could be brought inside the house. He snores loudly when asleep and eats plenty. When he is brought into the house he runs directly towards my room so he could lay down there, the reason for this is because my room has an air conditioner and the room's floor is cold so it would be very comfortable there.

            Here is Pablo in Tagaytay, Lumars Restaurant. He is wearing a shirt and has a Gold chain on his neck that is clearly made of plastic. Me and my Grandmother are guarding the dog and making it so he wont run away from us. Even thought he has a leash on he wont move until my father would move too. He is a nice dog that would seldomly bite another dog or human.
